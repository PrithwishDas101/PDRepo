        <h1>-“Forever BN: A Friendship Carved in Chalk and Chaos”-</h1>
        <p>
            In the corridors of Class 12, where the chalk dust mixed with dreams and teenage rebellion, 
            a group of eight unlikely legends came together to form what would soon become an unforgettable 
            bond — the BN gang. <br>
            No one understood what "BN" originally stood for but what truly mattered were the madness, 
            mischief, and memories they created together. <br>
            The BN family was a crazy mix of personalities, 
            each with their own hilarious nickname that stuck like glue:Lebu, Keltu, Hawa, Mashi Adibashi ,
            Mr. Cow ….Bullying each other was a sport — nicknames changed every week, embarrassing photos 
            were circulated on birthdays, and no one was spared. <br>
            But no matter how badly they roasted each other, the loyalty was unshakable. 
            Even the teachers loved (and sometimes feared) BN. Some teachers laughed along with their antics,
            others rolled their eyes — but all remembered them. <br>
            Their school days were a canvas painted with vibrant strokes of mischief and laughter. 
            Cheating in exams wasn't just a clandestine act; 
            it was an art form perfected by the BN crew, 
            often involving elaborate schemes and surprising teamwork. 
            From whispering answers, and expertly distracting invigilators, 
            the BN group had it all figured out. <br>
            Fights? Oh, they had those too. Over silly things — like who stole the shoe, 
            or who flirted with someone else’s crush. 
            But by the next lunch break, it was all forgotten over a shared packet of chips or a round of UNO. <br>
            As the final bell of their school life rang, 
            signifying the end of an era, 
            the BN crew faced the daunting prospect of life beyond the familiar classrooms. 
            But their bond, forged in the fires of shared experiences and countless inside jokes, 
            only grew stronger. While college and careers pulled them in different directions, 
            the "get-togethers" became sacred rituals. Whether it was a spontaneous late-night session, 
            a planned reunion, or simply a group call filled with boisterous chatter, 
            these gatherings were a chance to relive old memories, poke fun at each other, 
            and reinforce the unbreakable ties that bound them. <br>
            BN isn't just a friend group. <br>
            It's a legacy of laughter, loyalty, and love — born in classroom benches, 
            grown through pranks and punishments, and living on through every memory they continue to create. <br>
            Forever 8. Forever BN.
