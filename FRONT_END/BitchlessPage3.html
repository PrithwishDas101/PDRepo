                Shreyas also known as Gablu boy is a tiny little conspicuous boy with interest in even tinier
                things but there was a time when his interest lied in big things such as a huge cylinder.
                It all came down for him when the big fat cylinder did not like him back.
                What did Gablu boy do? Well he moved down his gear and focused on the minor leagues.
                Soon enough the white privelages did him good and he was swarmed with loads and loads of mini-
                cupcakes. He even earned himself the reputation of the great Benzema 15 but only a year later
                he also earned the reputation of Vinicius 16.

                Throughout his school life Shreyas has been a curious child. Being a tiny kid,
                he was looked down upon for his height and his innocent yet deceiving looks.
                However, his mind was filled with all sorts of naughty words and thoughts.
                He's a good kid but sometimes the ideas that sprouts out from his small head used to 
                just wreck havoc

                Shreyas is also an equivocator. You can always expect to find him in group photographs every where
                even if they are people of a different school, state or country. Such is his talent. Man is everywhere

            Shreyas might be a kid hunter but he is indeed a talented photographer,
            His skills as a photographer often captured the memories of B.N with unmatched
            creativity. His photographs are a testament to his dedication and we are proud to
            have such a friend.
