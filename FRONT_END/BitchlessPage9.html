      <h2>👨‍💻Mr. Zero Two👨‍💻</h2>
      <p>
        Now we come to a man who's half evolved and thus is 6 foot but a hairy nigga. 
        He loves anime though but he just doesn't watch anime — no, no. I’m talking full-blown “Zero Two is my 
        emotional support girlfriend” kinda guy. Sure he likes Sydney Sweeny and Ana de Armas like the rest of
        us but his love for Zero Two? I am not sure, he might make some code to make his own zero two bot marry it.
        Man is great at coding but how much will he contribute it for good I'm not too sure. He can be evil at times
        and the affection he shows for our dudumiya chan is kinda concerning, I mean we all love dudumiya but even
        dudumiya used to be worried when sag touched his dudu. Man used to be beast in education back in 10th grade.
        I used to think he'd be JEE AIR 1 in two years but despite scoring higher than any of us. He shall be the first
        to leave for college so we wished him luck.
