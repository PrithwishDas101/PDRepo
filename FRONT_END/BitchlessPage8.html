      <h2>Sundarban Tale</h2>
      <p>
        Tublu is a very good member. 
        However to trult learn about Tublu one must learn about his origin lore.
        Tublu's father once ventured to Sundarban with his friends. 
        At night he was camping out with his friends in the midst of the forest. 
        He could not sleep, something kept him awake. 
        So he strolled out of his camp and walked the night through the jungle watching the flora
        and fauna of the great sundarban. 
        He got tired and took a piss on a huge oak tree. 
        While pissing he suddenly noticed two eye glowing beside the tree. 
        Tublu's father was scared to death, 
        he tried to run away but the creature grabbed his meat and jumped on top of him. 
        Tublu's father in that starry night under the crescent moonlight saw the face of the creature.
        He described it as the most gorgeous face of a woman he'd ever seen. 
        He fell in love at that very instant, he made sweet sweet love with the naked body of Tublu's mom,
        and when morning came, he returned home and married her. Thus, the reason we call Tublu Adibashi.
        Tublu's mother can cook, her homemade soyabean can charm the hell out of any man I know. 
        And so Tublu thrived under the parentship of a city boy and a tribal mom.

      <h2>Harem Tale</h2>
      <p>
        Everyone that believes those hentai manga with the mc having a harem of gals is utterly fake are very
        mistaken. As tublu is one such mc in our world who at one point had a harem of 13 gals. Well preparing for
        JEE made him focus on studies but before that, up till 10th grade, Tublu was the king of our school.
        He gossiped with the girls he liked, kissed the ones he likes and made passionate love with the ones
        he wanted to. I shall not go into much details but there was one particular girl in school that Tublu
        loved the most. However, as the story goes the girl never liked him. She was a daughter to his English
        teacher too, which is why in his ICSE examination Tublu scored a great number in English but all to no avail.
        The girl had someone else in her mind, yet she played with Tublu's mind making him believe she loved him
        more than anyone in this world. Tublu wanted to buy her ice-creams, spend time with her and what not. Once
        there was a power cut in school and the boys and I were hanging out in the balcony when I saw tublu was missing.
        Now where might he be? Well, he was actually giggling with his "loyl" in the room all alone. Man thought 
        he had everything figured out only to find out that she was seeing someone else that entire time. So, from 
        11th grade his priority turned towards Education and B.N.
