        <h2>ðŸ’‹ Keltu Chan Our Labh</h2>
        <p>
          We love you Keltu Chan!!!ðŸ’–ðŸ’–<br>
          It is no secret how much we love our keltu. It all began in 12th grade during fall
          that a friend of ours tried to piss keltu off when he was doing Maths. Now, Keltu is a devoted 
          Mathematics student and all because of his teacher who taught him really well. We told our friend
          to not bother him but he didn't listen. To annoy keltu, he repeatedly called out to him,
          "Keltu I labh you". At first Keltu was silent, then when his radar burst he went out like a nuclear core.
          After a lot of time, Keltu came to realize we annoy him because we labh him so it began. We called out to
          him how much we loved him and it hasn not stopped ever since.

        <p>
          Keltu chan's father is a great hero of our state. We all look up to him immensely. Ever since our childhood
          we have seen him come as a chief guest in our school events. It was because he is a national treasure.
          He is a fire fighter who has countless deeds to be called a hero. However, one day Keltu was kinda snippy,
          he said y'all know why there are so many places burning down all these years near our town. We asked why what's 
          going on? He said it's me. I like arsonry. I like to burn places down. We all sat down and discussed the 
          issue. At the end of the day it was resolved however, the staggering news that Keltu burned places down
          and senior keltu watering it down was too ironic and funny.

        <p>
          Hey so, this is kinda out of hand but it is very very real and it although does not happen anymore but we
          will never know. A rumour spread during our mid term exams in 12th grade that Keltu's high grades
          in Mathematics was not just because of his efforts. Our math teacher who shall remain nameless might
          have been given some service under his work table at school by keltu chan. The method is popular
          to improve grades but Keltu was already excellent at maths, maybe the teacher was more than a teacher 
          to him but the rumours became very evident when in our final exam despite trying very hard the rest of us
          scored average yet Keltu scored the highest. There was a heated arguement between him and another member
          where accusations were thrown but keltu simply walked away and returned a long time only during math class
          together with our teacher. Suspicions rose more and they never really ended. School did, so hopefully
          that relationship did as well.

        <h2>ðŸ¦Ž The Lizard Tale</h2>
        <p>
          It is a real story about Domkol and Tiktiki. Listen well. It was a rainy day. 
          Domkol and Tiktiki run from the school together with no umbrella . 
          They come by a shop with a shed. There was no one at the shop at that moment. 
          They feel cold so they thought about going inside the store. 
          They started to undress as their clothes were all wet. 
          Domkol's pipe started rising up but it was not big enough so Tiktiki blushed at the size. 
          But, they had to do something to make them feel warm inside them. 
          So , Tiktiki thought of using the pipe no matter its size. Domkol put his pipe inside Tiktiki. 
          It only lasted 15 seconds. It was not enough to satisfy Tiktiki . 
          Domkol felt tired after his "long" 15 seconds , so he slept all naked beside Tiktiki. 
          Tiktiki was frustrated. She wore her wet clothes and ran from there and tried to call her male friends . 
          After 10 minutes her friends came , they took all kinds of photos of Domkol's pipe while Domkol was sleeping . After that they left , when Domkol woke up he realised that 
          he was all alone and it was late . 
          He rushed home and saw his parents disappointed. 
          Domkol's father was ready with his pipe to beat the shit out of Domkol. 
          Domkol had no idea what happened. Then, his parents told him about his small pipe pictures. 
          Domkol got his ass beaten. The next day at school , Domkol went to Tiktiki , 
          but Tiktiki was already having sex with his friend , which traumatized him. 
          He was not all ready for all of this. He said to himself that he would change. 
          But he didn't. So he is still waiting for Tiktiki to return to his life.
