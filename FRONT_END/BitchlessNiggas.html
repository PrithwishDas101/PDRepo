        <p> As all things stands,
            A group of radically ionised rascals decided to form a tiny community with various
            sorts of people to bring forth a series of events that shaped up their otherwise
            stressful highschool life into a wondrous memories full with pleasure, giggles
            and ambiguity.<br><br>

            However B.N was no ordinary group of individuals met by happenstance, it was purely
            on Divine orders tocause chaos. There are all sorts of allegations against these
            people, their reputation however precedes them. As bad as you think they might be, they
            have all sorts of talents from breaking bed to stealing panties. Ahem yeah, some are even
            kids lover yeah and some are still in love with their 2D waifus and some won't give up on
            their lost love. While others are happily committed in a relationship with their right
            hand. <br><br>

            From sitting at the back rows moaning out to distract classes they have grown up to
            graduate from highschool and move onboard with their college degrees in different streams.
            But, The bond they made? They each know they will not find it elsewhere. <br><br>

            Well the kids may have been ruthless on their teachers and well their surrounding humans
            but they are academically inclined and will surely all lead healthy and successful lives.
            That being said how about we venture into the past ey?<br><br>

            There was once a time when A member of this group fell in love with a lizard, yeahh a lizard.
            Obviously the lizard didn't like him back and things didn't proceed but a whole marriage was
            planned for it which never happened.<br><br>

            Ahh yes marriage, we have another member who was so in love with a literal cylinder that
            he almost stole her to kalibari and married her. Yes Audacity of kids nowadays huh! Well
            having been rejected by a cylinder of the same age, he was heartbroken and moved on to the
            next generation of young ones.<br><br>

            And there was one lad that was so in lust he became a slave to a woman for 3 damn years.
            It was because of the B.N that he removed the shackles of his master and asked her
            to FUCK OFF!!! <br><br>

            Then one of the members gained fame in India by heroically giving out milk to the whole
            population, he's called the milkman of India and his heroic deeds was deemed necessary by
            the rest of the members to commemorate his deeds by gifting him a cow shirt<br><br>

            And then we come to a member who gave up his religion to love a girl from bihar but little
            did he know that his girl will come to not love her anymore. But, in his days as a bihari
            lover he gained the powers of bihari haki. Every bihari girl cannot help but fall for his
            bihari rizz. <br><br>

            Then comes a man straight from the forests of sundarban. He knew nothing of civilised men,
            we taught him, fed him and gave him to a wealthy family. However as life went on he lost
            memories of those events, he only remembers being in the city and making love to every
            women at our school. <br><br>

            And, then we have the best member who's not having beef with anyone, man's just about his own 
            business. It's a little upsetting seeing his military dad send choppers over our heads to keep
            us in check though, but we are good. <br><br>

            At last we have someone who is unique and has the potential to be the most successful amonsgt us
            but he's also very likely to be man who buys his own anime body pillows and marries their own 
            waifu chatbots so i don't know really. <br><br>
