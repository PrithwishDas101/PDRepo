        <h2>🎆Bihari Haki🎆</h2>
        <p>
            Ayushman rather known as Bihari is a strange man. He was born bengali, speaks, eats and shits 
            in bengali yet he choses to cross path with bihari. He was unmatched bihari aura or what we call
            Bihari haki! Ayushman can conjure every bihari woman in his 50m viscinity. Girls come running 
            even during classes to ask the teacher, "Ma'am can I have Ayushman?🥵" Such is the strength of his
            Bihari Haki. He never liked this strength of his until when he thought why should he not use the 
            strength God bestowed upon him. He did not wish to be called Mr. Bihari ji, however he values his 
            friends and he accepted the name which was given to him. Often times he refers to himself as Mr. BIhari ji
            He however is in his pre time-skip era, With time he shall improve and unlock Advanced Bihari Haki and then
            no bihari can ever resist him anymore.

        <h2>🌞Surjo Conqueror🌞</h2>
        <p>
            Mr. Bihari jii is an epic hero of our world. One day during his childhood there, humanity faced a
            great calamity. The scientists said that the Sun would explode and it's explosion would take us out.
            There was panic, disarray and a state of alarm all around the globe. Little Mr. Bihari ji was worried,
            he could not allow the world to just end. One day he told his mum that he will protect us all and dashed 
            out. He was running to the highest point of his town. Once he reached it, with his dormant strength and 
            courage from his voice he shouted "SURJO TOR MAA KE CHUDI!!!". He was 5 back then. Suddenly the very next
            day the scientists came live on television and said that they were wrong with their calculations.
            They said the Sun would not explode soon but it will take another billion years rather. Everyone rejoiced
            but the true hero was never mentioned in the newspaper or the television. It is only known by us 8.

        <h2>🍋Lebu Lover🍋</h2>
        <p>
            The year was 2023, the day was gorgeous, the sun was out. We were at school enjoying our lunch break when
            Mr. Bihari ji said well niggas do you wanna hear a tale? We said bring it on! And, he went on. He revealed
            his love for mousumbi lebu. He went on saying he loved how juicy they were and how impeccably well shaped
            they were. Whenever he saw lebu hanging from a tree anywhere, he used to lose his footing. He said 
            he was even chased out of people's houses and property for trying to eat lebu directly from the branches of 
            lemon trees. He even said he would not mind giving up womanizing if he could just be allowed to marry a Lebu.
            We were shocked that day but given it's Mr. Bihari ji we weren't really.
