        Bhattu is our best member. I am sure everyone would agree to this. Bhattu is a very kind soul and 
        honestly there is not one thing I can say against him. Well we started calling him bhattu when we met 
        him after a very long time in school which was after the lockdown. We were shocked to see how much weight 
        he would gained. We did not knew instantly but slowly we learned that Bhattu was pregnant. He was carrying
        2 kids inside him. By the end of our school he had been carrying 4. Bhattu's dad is a military man who
        hunts down terrorists in Kashmir. Whenever  bhattu hanged out with us there were choppers hovering over us to
        keep check on Bhattu. Yeah crazy I know. However the best thing about Bhattu is his pet pussy in his home.
        It was a very juicy pussy and we all loved it. Her name was Lucy. So we liked to refer to her as LJP - Lucy
        Juicy Pussy.  We always annoyed him with the Lucy juicy pusys thing but he never once minded any of it.
        That's how good Bhattu is.
